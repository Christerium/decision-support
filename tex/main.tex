\section{Introduction}
We only need to add edges with G.add edge(node1, node2, capacity)
It autmatically adds nodes

Pyvis does not add nodes automatically

net.toggle physics(True), sometimes makes sense to set to False, It makes the graph dragable

Generate $C_l$ cut where $\gamma = 1$ and generate $C_m$ where $\gamma = u$.
Then calculate the bisection to obtain a new $\hat{\gamma}$. 
Then generate a cut with $\hat{\gamma}$ and do this until we find a cut that has less than $B$ large edges.

% Transform the problem to max clique,
